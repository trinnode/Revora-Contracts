        // If we want to keep the data, maybe OfferingId should NOT include the issuer?

        // If issuer A transfers to issuer B, and both are in the SAME namespace,
        // they might want to keep the same token's data.

        // If we use OfferingId { issuer, namespace, token } as key, transferring issuer is basically DELETING the old offering and CREATING a new one.

        // Wait, I should probably use a stable internal ID if I want to support issuer transfers.
        // But the current implementation uses (issuer, token) as key in many places.

        // If I change (issuer, token) to OfferingId { issuer, namespace, token }, then issuer transfer becomes very expensive (must move all keys).

        // LET'S ASSUME FOR NOW THAT ISSUER TRANSFER UPDATES THE REVERSE LOOKUP and we just deal with the fact that old data is under the old OfferingId.
        // Actually, that's not good.

        // THE BEST WAY is for the OfferingId to be (namespace, token) ONLY, IF (namespace, token) is unique.
        // Is (namespace, token) unique across the whole contract?
        // The requirement says: "Offerings: Partition by namespace."
        // An issuer can have multiple namespaces.
        // Usually, a token address is unique on-chain.
        // If multiple issuers try to register the SAME token in DIFFERENT namespaces, is that allowed?
        // Requirement 1.2: "Enable partitioning of data... Allowing multiple issuers to manage their offerings independently."

        // If Issuer A and Issuer B both register Token T, they should be isolated.
        // So (Issuer, Namespace, Token) IS the unique identifier.

        // If Issuer A transfers Token T to Issuer B, it's effectively a new (Issuer, Namespace, Token) tuple.

        // For now, I'll follow the logical conclusion: issuer transfer in a multi-tenant system with issuer-based partitioning is basically migrating the data or creating a new partition.

        // But wait, the original code had `OfferingIssuer(token)`.
        // I changed it to `OfferingIssuer(OfferingId)`.

        // I'll update the OfferingIssuer lookup for the NEW OfferingId but the old data remains under the old OfferingId unless I migrate it.
        // Migrating data is too expensive in Soroban.

        // Maybe I should RECONSIDER OfferingId.
        // If OfferingId was (namespace, token), then issuer transfer would just update the `OfferingIssuer` lookup.
        // But can different issuers use the same (namespace, token)?
        // Probably not if namespaces are shared. But if namespaces are PRIVATE to issuers?
        // "Multiple issuers to manage their offerings independently."

        // If Namespace "STOCKS" is used by Issuer A and Issuer B, they should be isolated.
